# Lexia

*Lexia* is a simple game experiment in HTML5 for the [one game a month]() of february 2014.

You go "looping" using teleporters to different scenarios until you get the flag.

Here I learned: 

- Multi-layers
- FPS limitations
- Sound
- Screen Panning
- Use [Tiled](http://mapeditor.org) for levels.
- Basic profiling
- Gamepad!

The art is from [Kenny's incredible platformer art](http://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-complete-pack-often-updated), also in [The Open Game Art Bundle](http://open.commonly.cc/), sounds are from [Jute's RPG sounds](http://opengameart.org/content/items-door-fire-weapon-hits), and background music from [Nutcase Nightmare](http://ncase.me/)  also in [The Open Game Art Bundle](http://open.commonly.cc/).

[Play Lexia](http://diogok.net/lexia) using WASD+Space or Gamepads DPad+A.
